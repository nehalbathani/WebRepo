        "description": "The biggest attraction on Maui is more than 100 ft. below the ocean. Atlantis Submarines is your ticket to see it. Take an once-in-a-lifetime undersea adventure in an Atlantis Submarine, the world's first and most technologically advanced passenger submarine. You will journey into a spectacular blue world more than 100 feet below the surface in spacious air-conditioned comfort. To enhance its sub tour experience and help improve the marine environment, Atlantis embarked on creating an artificial reef in December 2005 by sinking the aged Carthaginian replica of a 19th century supply vessel. The sunken Carthaginian, which needed major repairs and would have been scuttled at sea otherwise, is anchored to a sandy bottom in 95 feet of water that is devoid of coral reef. The resulting artificial reef will develop into a self-sustaining habitat for indigenous fish, coral and other marine life. Join us aboard the Atlantis Submarine in Maui to witness the new resting home of the Carthaginian. From December through May, Atlantis guests may enjoy whale watching during the ship-to-shore journey. All tours provide narration in Japanese, Chinese and Korean via headsets. Reservations for this tour are highly recommended.",

        "description": "The Submarine Tour takes place in the Atlantis 48-passenger submarine and has been featured on National Geographic specials. Each guest will receive an Atlantis Souvenir Dive Log. Climb aboard one of our Atlantis 48-passenger submarines. Being in a submarine and descending to 100 feet underwater is an adventure in itself. You will also get to see real marine life up close. The Atlantis Waikiki dive site is home to many Hawaiian fishes, coral, and turtles. Known for its quality and safety, Atlantis is an eye-opening experience that takes you beyond the classroom as you learn about coral, reef life and submersibles while visiting our sunken shipwrecks, airplane and other artificial reefs. Atlantis has a spacious air-conditioned interior, large view ports and comfortable seating. If you haven't been to the bottom of the ocean before, this tour is a \"must do!\"",
        "notes": "Dress for fun. There is a natural color change phenomenon that takes place as you descend through the water colume. Vibrant reds change to dark maroons, and florescent colors come alive as if they are battery operated! So, when you come aboard the Atlantis submarine, dress for fun and wear reds, and florescent colors and watch how they change before your very eyes.\r\n\r\nTotal tour time from the Hilton pier is approximately 90 minutes. Actual underwater tour time is 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nAudio headset narrations available in English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.",

        "description": "Mahalo for choosing Ocean Sports' Mid-Morning Whale Watch departing from Anaeho'omalu Bay!\r\nWhat could be more exciting than watching a Humpback Whale spout, swim and breach?! And what could be cuter than seeing a Humpback calf learning about life from his mother? All Ocean Sports Whale Watches include interpretation of the whales' behaviors by our trained naturalists, and we'll even deploy our underwater hydrophone so you can hear the haunting songs of the Humpbacks (weather permitting). The morning light makes for great photos!\r\nThis cruise includes refreshing canned soft drinks and individually wrapped bar snacks (due to COVID-19 regulations, snack selection will vary).\r\nOur Mid-Morning Whale Watch is GUARANTEED... see a Humpback or ride again for FREE!\r\n",

Please call us if you have questions or concerns about boarding conditions.\r\n",

Your experienced guides are well versed in interpreting the whale behavior and sharing what the latest research is teaching us about these often mysterious creatures.  Why do they sing?  Why do they breach? We just don\u2019t know the exact answer, but it sure is fun to experience!  \r\nIncluded in your tour is\u2026\r\n-A knowledgeable guide to teach you about the whales\r\n-A variety of snacks\r\n-Juice, soft drinks and water\r\n-No fighting for space to see since our boats only carry 6 passengers max!!\r\n-Great memories to last a lifetime!\r\n \r\nWe will do our best to keep you out of the elements but rain gear is never a bad idea throughout the South Kauai Winter Season.

        "description": "Kohola is the Hawaiian word for whale and throughout the winter our waters are filled with the sounds and views of the spectacular Humpback Whales!  These charismatic creatures are the size of a school bus and often can be as curious about us as we are about them!  \r\nHumpbacks are here explicitly to breed and give birth in our warm protected waters.  You tour may see social grouping ranging from moms nursing their newborns to large males fighting for a female\u2019s affection.  Your experienced guides are well versed in interpreting the whale behavior and sharing what the latest research is teaching us about these often mysterious creatures.  Why do they sing?  Why do they breach? We just don\u2019t know the exact answer, but it sure is fun to experience!  \r\nIncluded in your tour is\u2026\r\n-A knowledgeable guide to teach you about the whales\r\n-A variety of snacks\r\n-Juice, soft drinks and water\r\n-A bit of quiet time to listen for the whales song through a specialized microphone and amplifier (weather permitting)\r\n-No fighting for space to see since our boats only carry 6 passengers max!!\r\n-Great memories to last a lifetime!\r\n \r\nWe will do our best to keep you out of the elements but rain gear is never a bad idea throughout the South Kauai Winter Season.  The whales aren\u2019t afraid to get wet!!  Bring along a camera to record the memories or give us a call to reserve a waterproof HD video/12mp image camera to rent.  ",

This site over looks the Olokele Canyon owned by the Robinson Family and is totally inaccessible to the public otherwise.   You will be able to view the vastness of this particular canyon and the wonders of possible rainbows and waterfalls in the distance.  The canyon is sometimes called the East Fork of the Waimea Canyon and extends from Waimea to the back west side of Mt. Waialeale Crater.  There are no public roads or overlooks by land to view this spectacular site.  A number of films were produced at this location such as one of the scenes from the movie Jurassic Park.\r\nThe pilot will discuss the Robinson Family history and the discuss plans to develop the property into a preserve for native Hawaiian plants endemic to the Hawaiian Islands Keith Robinson.\r\nAfter the 30-minute stopover, the flight will continue on its normal air tour around the island.\r\nAscend over to the Kokee State Park and soar into major valleys along the Napali Coastline.

        "description": "Aloha! Over 50 years ago, Grandpa started our family business in this sacred Wailua River Valley. We created our tropical paradise to celebrate the Hawaiian spirit of aloha that he loved and lived by. Today, four generations of my family continue to honor that tradition with the most famous of Hawaiian celebrations, the luau. We welcome you to share the traditions of our island home and become part of our \"ohana.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the heart of any luau is the pa'ina, the feast, and we'll make sure you don't go hungry. Kalua pig roasted in the earthen imu oven. Cousin Gary's secret recipe for teriyaki beef. Ono mahimahi and tasty chicken adobo. Our family bowl of poi (which Grandma insists you try). We'll even get some of you up on stage to try some hula moves as dinner winds down.\r\n\r\nFood may be the heart of a luau, but music is the soul. Our Hawaiian ancestors preserved their history by passing down songs and chants called mele. At our luau, we celebrate these traditions, as well as the songs and dances from other cultures that live in our tropical paradise. The lyrical sway of the Hawaiian hula, the colorful precision of the Tahitian drum dances and the fiery emotion of the Samoan fire knife dance all speak deeply of the people who have come to call Hawaii home. We proudly share this rhythm of aloha with you.\r\n\r\nKamika Smith, General Manager / Vocals / Ukulele\r\n",

        "description": "Sharing Songs and Legends of the Wailua River Valley is a Family Tradition In 1946, Walter Smith, Sr. and his wife, Emily, started our family business with a small rowboat and a borrowed outboard motor. Four generations later, we continue Grandpa's tradition of sharing our love of Kauai and its rich cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nDuring the two mile river journey, you'll hear songs and stories of ancient Hawaii, like the King's Highway, sacred Mount Kapu, and the First Hau Tree. In addition, guests enjoy learning the hula during a lesson provided by a young hula dancer. Everyone gets into the act during the river cruise!\r\n\r\nSmith's famous Wailua River cruise boats are powered by an ingenious rear-engine system invented by Walter Smith, Sr. The spacious, open-air boats provide excellent views from either side during the trip upstream.\r\n\r\nThe Wailua River is known as ,the only navigable river, in all Hawaii. The river's fresh water pours down from Mt. Wai'ale'ale, one of the wettest spots on the planet. Lands along the river were the sacred capital of ancient Kauai and the birthplace of the island's ali'i, or royalty.\r\n\r\nAt the Fern Grotto landing, you'll enjoy a short nature walk through the rainforest to the lush Fern Grotto.\r\n\r\nThe Fern Grotto is a geological wonder of Kauai. Ferns grow upside down from the roof of the grotto, which was formed millions of years ago. Native Hawaiian plants and colorful exotic tropical plants provide a rain-forest atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe entire tour takes one hour and 20 minutes round-trip.\r\n\r\n ",

The lyrical sway of the Hawaiian hula, the colorful precision of the Tahitian drum dances and the fiery emotion of the Samoan fire knife dance all speak deeply of the people who have come to call Hawaii home.

        "description": "Blue Water Rafting\r\nKANAIO / MOLOKINI TOUR\r\nOur Ultimate adventure!\r\n\r\nSpinner Dolphins The Kanaio Sea Caves... Passengers can expect a rare treat as they tour along Maui's Gold Coast past Wailea and Makena to a remote and inaccessible coastline with spectacular views of the slopes of Mt. Haleakala. About 200 years ago at Kanaio, molten lava exploded from a side vent and poured into the ocean forming incredible lava arches, grottos and sea caves. Photographers will delight with the array of unique formations that await at every turn.\r\n\r\nDolphins Dead Ahead!... Following Kanaio, you will cruise to the protected waters of La Perouse Bay, frequently encountering a pod of spinner dolphins , including babies, along the way or in the bay itself. Named for their acrobatics, these playful mammals will frolic in the wave produced by our boat sometimes only a few feet from the bow!\r\n\r\nOn many occasions, our snorkelers have been approached by dolphins while in the water. This experience has been described as spiritual and is a visual and auditory experience that one never forgets.\r\n\r\nA continental Breakfast consisting of individually wrapped muffin and assorted fruit cup is served before snorkeling. Water and hawaiian juices available. A remote snorkeling site will be offered such as the calm protected corner of the bay or the La Perouse Pinnacle which is teaming with fish. (Time and conditions permitting)\r\n\r\nMolokini Crater... After departing La Perouse Bay, you'll head for Molokini, a short 20 minute ride from the bay. There we will generally offer up to three unique sites including the inside rim, the outer reef and the back side of the crater. By this time of the day conditions at Molokini are generally calm and most of the bigger boats have departed or are departing leaving plenty of room for uncrowded snorkeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrift snorkeling the outer reef... is one of the many highlights of this tour. Imagine snorkeling one of the most beautiful coral reefs in the world drifting gently along with the current as your boat follows near by for your safety. Glide past a variety of butterfly fish, wrasses, black and pink tailed durgeons, all posing against a backdrop of beautiful coral only 3 feet below ... truly a photographers dream!\r\n\r\nFor an exciting panoramic view, venture over to the edge to witness an awesome 200 ft. drop. It's like looking off the edge of the world!\r\n\r\nBack Side... (optional site) Time and conditions permitting, another drift snorkel may be offered on the back side of Molokini, a favored dive site for advanced scuba divers. The depth here is about 300ft. but the lighting and the view of the vertical wall of rock, coral and fish is phenomenal. This site may also be offered as an alternative to the inside under certain sea conditions.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe variety of scenery and wildlife encountered both above the surface and below truly make this tour one of the most comprehensive snorkeling adventures available on Maui.\r\n \r\nAfter Molokini we make one more stop in Makena where we serve a delicious lunch consisting of individually wrapped ham and cheese or turkey and cheese croissants*, nut free chocolate chip cookie, water and hawaiian juices. Here we snorkel with sea turtles and spotted eagle rays near pristine lava fingers. these turtles, although endangered and protected, are accustomed to seeing snorkelers and do not mind being photographed as they surface for air just a few feet away. \r\n\r\n*Vegan and gluten free options are available if mentioned in comments section.\r\n\r\n",

Once briefed, fitted with top quality gear and in the water, over one hour of snorkeling time is available at prime locations away from the crowds.\r\n\r\nBy arriving at the crater just after most of the other boats have just departed, we find the area to almost empty alowing us to drift snorkel large areas of the rim if we choose to.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular and spectacular drifts is over the outer reef formed by the rim of the volcano which at points is only two or three feet deep and then drops off on the outside to 200feet. Gliding over the reef gives one the \"feeling of flying\" as you look off the edge of the world!\r\n\r\nThe backside of Molokini might remind one of \"The Abyss\" as the wall plunges to depths of 300 to 400 feet. If the wind picks up on the inside of the crater, this area is often the calmest water for snorkeling. Tropical fish are just about everywhere, but the shafts of light, awesome visibilty, towering cliffs and sheer drop offs are what make this site so unique. \r\n\r\n",

        "description": "The Express Whale Watch/ Molokini Snorkel is a great way to combine snorkeling at Molokini with a whale watching adventure on a fast and maneuverable rigid hulled inflatable. We almost always make it to Molokini on this one but if conditions are not favorable, a shoreline alternate may be selected. Your passage to and from Molokini will take you through waters laden with Humpback whales with a high percentage of mother/calf/escort pods. Just today a whale surfaced less than ten yards from our boat and lifted her calf out of the water on her head to show us. Awesome! About one hour is devoted to snorkeling, and 1 1/2 hours to passage and whale watching. Beverages and gear are included. ",

The progression moves from flat water to surf, depending on the client\u2019s goals. Safety essentials, including wind, weather and tide basics, are included in the instruction. All instructors are Ocean Lifeguard, CPR & first Aid certified.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of standup paddle boarding is that it can be done anywhere with access to water. You don\u2019t need any specific conditions and the whole sport can be as hardcore or tranquil as you like.\r\n\r\nOne key advantage that stand-up has is the thorough way in which it can be used to develop your body and mind which can also benefit you outside of the sport.",

The Pearl Harbor Remembered Tour is led by an E Noa guide whose knowledge of and appreciation for these historic sites makes this memorial tour an experience to remember.  \r\n\r\nIt's early morning, and as you head towards Honolulu's infamous Pearl Harbor.
